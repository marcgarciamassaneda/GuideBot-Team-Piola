## Introduction

**Guidebot** is a Pyhton project that using a Telegram Bot, users can be guided from 
their location to a destination through a map obtained by [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org). 

## Prerequisites

The Pyhton packages used are the following:

- `networkx` to manipulate graphs.
- `osmnx` to obtain graphs from places.
- `haversine` to calculate distances between coordinates.
- `staticmap` to paint maps.
- `python-telegram-bot` to use Telegram.

You can install them via `pip3 install` like in the following example:

```
$ pip3 install networkx
```

Nonetheless, `osmnx` also requires to install `spatialindex` 
(installable with` brew install spatialindex` on Mac or
`apt install libspatialindex-dev` on Ubuntu). They can also be installed all with
Anaconda.

All the necessary software to run the project is in the file `requirements.txt`.

It's also required to have downloaded the Telegram application, as it will be the platform to interact with the bot.


## System architecture

The system consists of two modules:

- `guide.py`, which is an independent module with the function of getting and 
saving graphs corresponding to maps and make the calculations of the shortest routes.
- `bot.py`, 


## `guide` module

The `guide` module contains the following functions:

- `download_graph(place)`: Downloads an osmnx graph from a place.
- `save_graph(graph, filename)`: Saves the graph in a pickle format.
- `load_graph(filename)`: Loads a graph from a pickle file. The file must be in your system.
- `print_graph(graph)`: Prints every node and all its adjacent edges information
of a graph. It has debugging functionality.
- `get_directions(graph, source_location, destination_location)`: Gives a list with
information of the guidance of the shortest route from the source location to the destination location .
The two points are given through their coordinates (latitude, longitude). Every section of the route
has the following structure in the list:

```python
[...]

{'angle': 38.99600000000001, 'current_name': 'Carrer de Josep Aguilera i Mart√≠', 'dst': (41.9636285, 2.8204915), 'length': 212.721, 'mid': (41.9646037, 2.8207882), 'next_name': 'Pujada de la Creu de Palau', 'src': (41.965998, 2.8198635)},

{'angle': None, 'current_name': 'Pujada de la Creu de Palau', 'dst': (41.962369, 2.819995), 'length': 68.332, 'mid': (41.9621516, 2.8199782), 'next_name': None, 'src': (41.9627576, 2.8201146)},

{'angle': None, 'current_name': None, 'dst': None, 'length': None, 'mid': (41.962369, 2.819995), 'next_name': None, 'src': (41.9621516, 2.8199782)}]

````
- `plot_directions(graph, source_location, destination_location, directions, filename, width=400, height=400)`:
Draws a route to go from the source location to the destination location in a graph 
on a map in PNG format using `staticmap`.


## `bot` module

This module enables the connection between the user and Telegram. The bot begins downloading (or loading) a chosen fixed graph and then waits for the user's interaction. The Telegram user has several commands at his disposal to obtain information about the bot and start a guided route to a chosen destination:

- `/start`: starts the conversation.
- `/help`: offers help about the available commands.
- `/author`: shows information about the authors of the project.
- `/go destination`: starts a guidance from the location of the user to the chosen destination.
- `/where`: shows the current location of the user.
- `/cancel`: cancels the active guidance of the user.

The bot works for various users at the same time, as there is a global dictionary which stores the essential data of every user.

Finally, the users must share they live location to the bot before activating the guidance system or using the where command. It's used to track down the user's current location during the whole route.


## Execution

To use the bot, it is needed an _acces token_, which is an identifier provided by Telegram unique to identify every bot. To generate and implement one do the following steps:

- Visit the @BotFather bot on Telegram.
- Use the command `/newbot` and give the required information (full name and username of the bot).
- Save the generated _acces token_ into a file called `token.txt` in the same folder that the module `bot`.

Finally, to make the bot operative, it just has to be executed in the same folder that the module `guide.py` and the file `token.txt`. Then, all the users of Telegram will be able to use the bot.


## Examples
Below, there are some examples of the interaction between the user and the bot:

- The commands `/start`, `/help` and `/author`:

- The `/where` command shows the user its current location:

- The command `/go destination` begins the guidance of the user to the chosen destination. The bot keeps sending instructions as the user moves:

<img width="350" src="/Users/jofre/Desktop/GCED/AP2/GuideBot-Team-Piola/PROJECTE_FINAL/README_photos/checkpoint.png" />

<img width="350" src="/Users/jofre/Desktop/GCED/AP2/GuideBot-Team-Piola/PROJECTE_FINAL/README_photos/destination.png" />


- If the user uses the command `/where` or `/go` before sending its location, the bot sends a warning:

<img width="350" src="/Users/jofre/Desktop/GCED/AP2/GuideBot-Team-Piola/PROJECTE_FINAL/README_photos/location_error.png" />


- If the user types the command `/go` without a destination or it's out of the fixed graph's range (5km), the bot sends a warning. In this case the user types _Parlament Europeu_ as a destination, which is in Brussels and the fixed graph is Girona:

<img width="350" src="/Users/jofre/Desktop/GCED/AP2/GuideBot-Team-Piola/PROJECTE_FINAL/README_photos/destination_error.png" />


- Furthermore, if the current location of the user it's outside of the graph's range, another warning is sent. In this case the user types _Sagrada Fam√≠lia_ as a destination, but the fixed graph is Girona:

<img width="350" src="/Users/jofre/Desktop/GCED/AP2/GuideBot-Team-Piola/PROJECTE_FINAL/README_photos/inici_ruta.png" />


- Finally, if the user makes a mistake typing a command or the bot receives a casual message, a warning is sent:
